# Description:

This is our group's AI Tic Tac Toe Bot. 

# Dependencies:

This project uses:
- Pygame for the UI
- Google Gemini for (Gemini stuff)
- Graphviz for decision tree visualization.

To download these dependencies, run these commands in your terminal:
pip install pygame
pip install graphviz
pip install python-dotenv
pip install google-generativeai


In addition, Graphviz also requires you to download the Graphviz software, and to add it to your system PATH

To run the visualization code, you must install:

1. **Graphviz Software, Version 13.1.0** (for rendering)
    - Download from https://graphviz.org/download/, download version 13.1.0, using the exe listed
    - During installation, make sure to add Graphviz's `/bin` folder to your system PATH. There is an option to do so in the installer. If you miss this option during installation, you'll have to manually add it.

    Once the Graphviz software has been added to your system PATH, make sure you restart your IDE/Code Editor/Terminal, so it will update to display
